# Getting Started with Villa Trans

This is an Express.js application generated using Express Generator.

## `Installation`

### Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/GorMkrtchyann/transx.git
```

### Install packages

```
yarn
```

### Runs the app in the development mode


To start the application normally
```
yarn start
```

**can also use Nodemon for automatic reloading during development. Simply execute:**

```
yarn  dev
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the terminal console.

### Package installation as dependencies

```
yarn add <package...>
```

### Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode

```
yarn test
```

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### Builds the app for production to the `build` folder

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

```
yarn  build
```

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### The yarn eject command

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

```
yarn eject
```

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
